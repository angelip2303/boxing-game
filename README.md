## üìö TL;DR

This project was created for the _Inform√°tica Audiovisual_ course of the _Software Engineering_ degree at Uniovi. It consists of a simple game where you fight against an AI by interacting with the application through a camera connected to the client system. When the game is over, that is, any of the players' health gets to 0: the user is prompted with a black screen indacting the state of the game. If you want to play another game, just reload the page.

2. Search for **Use hardware acceleration when available**
3. Enable it
