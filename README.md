## üìö TL;DR

This project was created for the _Inform√°tica Audiovisual_ course of the _Software Engineering_ degree at Uniovi. It consists of a simple game where you fight against an AI by interacting with the application through a camera connected to the client system. When the game is over, that is, any of the players' health gets to 0: the user is prompted with a black screen indacting the state of the game. If you want to play another game, just reload the page.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable hardware acceleration

This is required for an optimal performance of the application; as we are using ml5.js the support of the computer's hardware is advisable. This way, we are allowing the use of the GPU for machine learning purposes. The steps for enabling it are the following:

1. Go to the settings of your browser
2. Search for **Use hardware acceleration when available**
3. Enable it

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

To play this simple game you just have to enable the usage of the camera for it to be used and a simple UI will be displayed showing the human-player on the left, while the IA is on the right. Notice how the system detects the wrists (parts of the body that can cause damage) highlighted in red, as well as the nose and eyes (parts of the body that may take damage) highlighted in white. Then, if a red-part of the body of a player hits a white-part of the other player, the latter receives some damage. The game is over when the health of any of the players is 0: the one who manages to survive wins!
